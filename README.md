# zener

Zener is an asynchronous state management library designed for use with Scala.js and React. It is built with Monix and heavily influenced by Diode. Its goal is to simplify and modularize state management in front-end applications. It can be used directly on top of ScalaJS-React to provide efficient asynchronous component-specific updates.
